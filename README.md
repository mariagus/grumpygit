## Grumpy Git

This application was my first React project! I built it as I went through the project section of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) front-end library certification.

It is a really simple application. You simply click the face of a grumpy git who then returns an angry quote. During this project, I enjoyed figuring out how to do animations in React.
